            <img src="./images/brideAndGroom.jpg" alt="Bhumi and Sahil" class="couple-img">

              <h2 class="couple-title">Introducing the Couple: From each other's perspective!</h2>
              <div class="title-divider"></div>

              <h3 class="bride-name">Bhumi</h3>
              <div class="name-underline"></div>
              <p class="bride-desc">Bhumi is the brightest, warmest presence in every room she walks into. Her laughter is contagious, and her heart is made of pure gold—always finding ways to show up for her family and friends with love and sincerity.

                She's a proud germaphobe, so if she's not carrying hand sanitizer, chances are she's holding a matcha instead. And if anyone so much as steps outside for five minutes, she'll seriously insist: "We smell like outside—you have to shower."
                
                Bhumi constantly challenges those around her to grow, reflect, and become the best versions of themselves—all while embracing them exactly as they are. She'll stay up late to watch basketball games just to show support, even though she's not exactly a fan (despite what she confidently claimed early on).
                
                A true travel enthusiast, Bhumi is always ready to explore every corner of the world—but no matter where she lands, she somehow always ends up with sushi and boba in hand.
              </p>
              <div class="name-divider"></div>

              <h3 class="groom-name">Sahil</h3>
              <div class="name-underline"></div>
              <p class="groom-desc">Sahil is calm, clever, and always one step ahead—except when it comes to Bhumi's biggest pet peeve: sitting on the bed in outside clothes. He does it anyway. Daily. It's fine. She's fine.

                But he more than makes up for it in every other way. Case in point: their very first date at Six Flags. Bhumi casually mentioned she gets dizzy on rides unless she has a fruit punch Gatorade. Most people would pick one up. Sahil rolled up with a trunk full. That pretty much sums it up—thoughtful, over-prepared, and always looking out for the little things that matter.
                
                He's the guy who always cooks for Bhumi (without being asked), knows exactly what she needs before she even says it, and will drive hours just to let her sleep in the car. He goes the extra mile in every way, showing love not through grand gestures but through everyday acts of kindness. That's just who he is..

It's where we've wandered together through the beautiful trails, discovered hidden gems in the lively city, and shared countless special moments that we'll treasure forever. From morning nature walks, shopping days, and unexpected adventures, this city holds so much of our story—each experience made even more meaningful because it's here, in a place that feels like home. More than anything else, it's all about the people, the moments, and the love we share.</p>

              <div class="question-underline"></div>
              <p>Okay, it's not Jersey or NYC—but Nashville holds its own when it comes to bagels. If you're craving a solid schmear or a biscuit with a twist, these are our go-to spots.</p>
              <p>When Sahil visited Nashville, Bhumi made it her mission to find the best local bagels that could rival those back home in Jersey. She wanted him to feel at home, one chewy, toasty bite at a time.</p>
              <p>We hope you feel the same—and that these spots make you feel right at home too.</p>
              
              <h4 class="whileyourhere-subheading">Benji's Bagels</h4>
              <p>True NYC-style bagels to Nashville—with a vibe that's laid-back, local, and seriously delicious.

Grab their favorite, Jalapeno cheddar bagel!</p>

              <h4 class="whileyourhere-subheading">Biscuit Love</h4>
              <p>Not a bagel spot, but worth the detour. Their Southern-style biscuits and famous bronuts are eggless—and ridiculously good.</p>

              <div class="question-underline"></div>
              <p class="faq-answer">Since this will be a traditional Hindu wedding ceremony, we encourage guests to wear traditional Indian attire if you have it—think vibrant colors, beautiful fabrics, and lots of joy.<br><br>That said, we want you to feel comfortable and confident. If you don't have Indian clothes, no worries at all! Wear whatever feels festive to you. Just keep in mind that the ceremony will take place in a Hindu temple, so out of respect for the space:<br>– Women should wear longer dresses or skirts that extend below the knees and have their shoulders covered<br>– Men should wear long pants and avoid shorts</p>

              <p class="faq-answer">As much as we'd love to celebrate with everyone, due to space limitations, we're only able to include a certain number of little ones. If your child is invited, they'll be listed on your RSVP count. It's truly difficult for us to make these decisions, and we deeply appreciate your understanding as we plan for an intimate and joyful day.</p>
